# DiscordChangelog
my own attempt to make a discord changelog. i will try to find most of the changes on my own, but if i don't, i *might* use the discord datamining commit comments.

since i'm not adding stuff from before i started (30 jun 2020), you can find older changelogs(?) on [the discord datamining repo](https://github.com/DJScias/Discord-Datamining/commits/master)
